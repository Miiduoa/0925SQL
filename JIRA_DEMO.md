# Jira Integration Demo

This branch demonstrates a workflow using a Jira issue key in branch names, commits, and PR titles.

Steps
- Branch name: `feature/PROJ-1-jira-demo`
- Commit message: `PROJ-1 Add Jira integration demo guide`
- PR title (when opened): `PROJ-1 Add Jira integration demo guide`

After installing the GitHub for Jira app and enabling the PR title check workflow, Jira should auto-link the branch/PR/commits to issue `PROJ-1`.
